# Chess
Chess game in C using Raylib â€“ 85% complete, core gameplay implemented; a few features still in development.

This is a chess game implemented in C using the Raylib library for graphics. The game is approximately 90% complete, with core functionality implemented, including piece movements, turn management, check and checkmate, and basic game rules. Some features, such as castling (king-side and queen-side), en passant and pawn promotion, are still under development.

The project demonstrates understanding of C programming, 2D graphics handling with Raylib, and basic game logic implementation.
